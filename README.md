## Styling

DONOT change directly to css file.
This resume is using the scss file for writing styles.

## Scss compilation

For compilation I am using a simple opensource tool [Scout](https://scout-app.io/) for the mac. This is available for windows as well.

Source folder of scss is `assets/scss/devresume.scss`. The destination folder for compilation in compiler(scout) must be set to `assets/css/devresume.css`
